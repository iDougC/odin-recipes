A sample project to put together the basics of HTML.
In this project we use: 
-headings
-paragraphs
-lists
-links
-images

We also further familiarized ourselves with the command line (linux ubuntu):
-Creating directories and files
-moving and renaming files
-Opening files in VS code from command line
-Opening HTML files from the command line

As well as this I used basic git tooling from the Github and the command line:
-Created a Github repo to house the project
-Cloned repo to local machine
-Add changes, committed them, and pished back to Github
